Visitor : After three weeks at home, I started to notice faint 3 inch horizontal lines on the left side of the TV screen, that were fixed in place, they did not move and they ran from the top of the TV screen to the bottom vertically.  I called Best Buy who told me over the phone that it wasn't my new TV, but an issue with my Cable provider.
Visitor : yes, I will gladly try this with you Danice
Agent : Sure, go ahead and see if that helps you.
Visitor : Please allow me one more minute to finish explaining what's the rest of the problems first do you know exactly what is FULLY wrong with the TV so that we can address ALL BROKEN ISSUES and try to resolve them. Thank you.
Agent : Yes,I can understand your concern with the issue.
Agent : However, to isolate the display issue with the TV, the TV should be powered on for an extended time.
Agent : That is the reason, I'm requesting you to check if the issue persists by following the troubleshooting steps mentioned in the link above to isolate the power issue.
Visitor : After the first set of black lines appeared on my left side of TV screen in background, I had my cable provider come onn3 separate occasions to look at and fix it.  He checked my TV on 3 separate occasions weeks apart and it is not my cable, it is the TV & now thevTV has 4 SAME TYPE BLACKNLINES ALLNACROSS SCREEN and continues to get worse daily.
Agent : Does this happen on all inputs (like DVD and cable box)?
Agent : Just to confirm; are we connected on the chat?
Visitor : and, then this morning, it just started turning on and off with that incessant annoying sound, which I suffer from migraines and its making me sick and my RX for my migraines from my neurologist is not working now, it's driving me INSANE ... It's been like TORTURE since 6:00 am on Friday, Marchb27, 2014.

Visitor : I haven't tried all the other apps, but the ones I have are working.
Agent : Please check once again and let me know if other apps are working fine.

Agent : Could you  provide me the complete Model Number of your TV ? 
Agent : You will find it on the rear/side panel of the TV. 
Agent : You will also find it on Press: Menu>>Support>>Contact Samsung. The model number starts with LN / UN/ PN .
Visitor : UN60F6300AFXZA
Agent : Thank you for the information.
Agent : Could you please provide me with the current firmware version of the TV.
Agent : You can find it at  Menu>>Support>>Contact Samsung>> Software version.
Visitor : T-MST12AKUC-1121.3
Agent : Thank you for the information.
Agent : I checked that as of now their is no latest firmware for this TV.
Agent : However, we can check by perfroming the Smart Hub reset.
Agent : When Smart Hub is reset all downloaded Apps are initialized; user accounts and settings are erased from the memory and all Smart Hub settings revert to factory default. Is that okay with you.
Visitor : yes
Agent : I will provide you with the link on how to perform a Smart Hub reset.
Agent : Please follow the instructions below.
Agent : 
Agent : Are you able to access the above link?
Visitor : yes
Agent : Please follow the instructions to perform the Smart Hub.

Visitor : Ok, finished setting it all back up and Netflix still does not work.
Agent : Thank you for waiting. I'll be with you in just a moment.
Agent : It seems the TV needs a firmware to fix this issue.
Agent : And as of now there is no such firmware available, to fix this issue.
Agent : However, you can contact Netlix once to isolate this issue.
Visitor : So, what you are saying is I won't be able to use the Netflix app on this Samsung TV I purchased so I could watch Netflix on it?
Agent : Yes, you can watch it, however, the Netflix is the developer of this App and I guess new firmware is required to fix this issue and as of now there is no such updates, we have to wait for the one to release.
Agent : Since Netflix is the developer of this App I would suggest you to contact Netflix once.
Agent : As all other apps are working fine the issue is not with the TV, it is with the Netflix.I would suggest you to contact Netflix once.
Agent : If you are looking for more details on the functionality of a product or would like to find answers to some of the questions, visit us at  for an interactive review of some of our Samsung products. 
Agent : Is there anything else I can assist you with?
Visitor : I don't think it is a Netflix problem if I can get onto Netflix through the web browser.  It is a problem with the preloaded app in the smart hub.  If I could uninstall and reinstall the actual app, that would be a start.  But I can't seem to do that because it's a preload.
Agent : I have just checked it, and yes this may get resolved the model which is 6300 and above faced this problem, we have a dedicated team for this.
Agent : I will provide you with the remote management number.
Agent : Please contact them they will surely fix this issue.
Agent : I recommend you contact our Remote Management support team to 1-800-SAMSUNG (1-800-726-7864) . RM Business Hours are 9am to Midnight EST Monday – Friday  and  9am to 9pm EST  Saturday and Sunday.
